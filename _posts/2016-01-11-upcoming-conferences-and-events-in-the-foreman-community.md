With FOSDEM, ConfigManagement Camp, DevConf, and our first ever Foreman
Construction Day fast approaching, I thought you might like a bit more detail
on our plans. Read on if you do!

## [FOSDEM 2016](https://fosdem.org), 30-31 January, Brussels

Once again a large part of the Foreman Community will be gathered in Brussels
for FOSDEM 2016. We have been granted a booth (I assume it will be in K
building, as per previous years) which we'll again be sharing with the oVirt
team. We'll have a nice Foreman/oVirt demo in place, as well as a variety of
swag for you to get. There should be Foreman people around the stand at any
time, so drop by and say hi!

For talks, check out the Config Management, Virtualization, and Container
devrooms for things that are relevant to Foreman. Oved Ourfali will be giving a
talk on oVirt/Foreman integration - see
[the schedule](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/virt_iaas_host_lifecycle_content_management_in_ovirt)

There's also going to be a Foreman Community dinner on the Saturday night
(30th). Venue is still to be confirmed, but if you want to join us, the latest
are on the [Google+ event](https://plus.google.com/b/102496134326414788199/events/co1nia0c7g6hk9b4msf98517s1o).
Sign up there, or mail me directly if you're not a fan of G+.

## [ConfigManagement Camp 2016](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu), 1-2 February, Ghent

Immediately after FOSDEM, we'll shift location to the beautiful city of Ghent
for our annual track at ConfigManagement camp. The Foreman track is now
[published](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/index.html#foreman) and looks
fantastic! If you don't already have your ticket, get on the
[waiting list](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/#registration) now, and hopefully we can
squeeze you in.

Socially, there's a general drinkup event on Monday for the whole conference,
and no doubt something impromptu will happen on Tuesday night. Which leads us
to...

## [Foreman Construction Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/foreman-construction-day-registration-19911909056), 3 February, Ghent

Immediately after CfgMgmtCamp, and in the same venue, we'll be holding our first ever
[Foreman Construction Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/foreman-construction-day-registration-19911909056).
This is a new event for us, and we're essentially aiming to have a
slightly-structured hack day. Roughly, the agenda for the day is:

* 09.30 Welcome / Introductions / Decide focus groups
* 10:00 Hack session 1 (with break around 11am)
* 12:00 Re-group to discuss progress so far / discuss roadblocks
* 12:40 Lunch
* 14:00 Hack session 2 (with break around 3pm)
* 15:20 Re-group to present results / further work
* 16:00 End

Since this is a hack event, times are only approximate. The aim is to dicuss
(probably with the help of a whiteboard) some of the things we can use
in-person time to solve. These don't *have* to be coding - I personally hope to
recruit some people to help me brainstorm community things. All attendees are
welcome to submit ideas for forming a group around (this is similar to the
'unconference' style of talk planning).

Once we have enough topics for everyone to get involved in, we'll spend most of
the morning getting started. Just before lunch, we can all get back together to
talk about how we're doing. The afternoon is pretty similar in structure. A
more detailed agenda is on the
[Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/foreman-construction-day-registration-19911909056).

Since we're in the same venue, the same catering applies as for
ConfigManagement - we'll be getting breakfast, lunch, and coffee/cake during
breaks. We should have a couple of rooms, so there's space to spread out and
get things done.

If you're interested in being part of this, and aren't signed up yet, please
grab a (free!) ticket at the event link above - tickets mean we can get the
catering numbers right :)

## [DevConf 2016](http://devconf.cz), 5-7 February, Brno

Finally, if you're not conferenced-out by then, we'll also have a booth at
DevConf 2016, Brno, Czech Republic. We've nothing official planned socially for
this one, but I've no doubt that we could get up to some mischief if we get
enough of us together. If you're in the area, do drop by!

# Wrap up

So, it's a hectic schedule for the next month - I'm currently busy finalising
all the things above. If you're going to be at any of these events, come and
introduce yourself; it's always great to put names (or IRC nicks) to faces!

If you can't make it, at least wave in the comments below - and let us know
where else we should be planning to be in the future,
