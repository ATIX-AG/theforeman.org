This year it was our pleasure to host Foreman’s 9th birthday party.

<!--more-->

## Once upon a time ...

On the 13th of July in 2009 Ohad Levy gave birth to a new project which was
later to be named "The Foreman"

Nine years later The Foreman is grown up and famous for managing and automating
a huge number of IT infrastructures with several thousands of servers. Today,
Foreman is also a major part of enterprise system management solutions like Red
Hat Satellite 6 and orcharhino.

The party started at 10 am with birthday presents for all party guests.
Everybody got t-shirts, stickers and foreman party helmets.  After a short
introduction we started our hack and try sessions. Powered by mate–tea and
cola, three groups worked very successfully on foreman-ansible, foreman-probing
and chat integration for foreman messaging. Only interrupted by a very short
lunch break the sessions went until 14:30 when the „official“ part started.

This time we could listen to very interesting talks: Bernhard and Markus from
ATIX showed us the possibilities of securing software repositories with gpg
keys. Dirk Götz from NETWAYS gave a very good overview and demo about his
favorite foreman plugins. Foreman Community-Developer Adam presented the latest
enhancements of the remote execution plugin and Ansible integration.

## What’s a birthday party without a cake? Nothing!

The Foreman turned nine – so we had a big birthday cake with nine candles!
After the Happy birthday song, Adam was chosen to blow out the candles and make
some well wishes for the birthday boy.

The party went on with interesting discussions over pizza, beer.
