Collection responses are used for `index` actions (i.e. - "Give me a collection of these items").

The collection response should contain the following metadata:

    {
        "total" : 3,
        "subtotal" : 3,
        "limit" : 3,
        "page" : 1,
        "per_page" : 20,
        "search" : null,
        "sort" : {
            "by" : "id",
            "order" : "asc'
        },
        "results" : [
            {
                "id" : 1,
                "uuid" : "51b7f2d4-f4eb-4d40-bc1d-d6c2e117631c",
                "name" : "system1",
                "description" : "Initial Registration Params",
                "location" : "None",
                "created_at" : "2013-11-06T22:31:11Z"
                "updated_at" : "2013-11-06T22:31:11Z"
                "type" : "Host",
            },
            {
                "id" : 2,
                "uuid" : "a837e9cd-9656-455e-a608-74dd016108b7",
                "name" : "system2",
                "description" : "Initial Registration Params",
                "location" : "None",
                "created_at" : "2013-11-06T22:31:11Z"
                "updated_at" : "2013-11-06T22:31:11Z"
                "type" : "Host",
            },
            {
                "id" : 3,
                "uuid" : "00a7df23-9e5e-45d0-8edf-ff28af2f6e89",
                "name" : "system3",
                "description" : "Initial Registration Params",
                "location" : "None",
                "created_at" : "2013-11-06T22:31:11Z"
                "updated_at" : "2013-11-06T22:31:11Z"
                "type" : "Host",
            }
        ]
    }

The response metadata fields are described below:

* `total` - total number of objects without any search parameters
* `subtotal` - number of objects returned with given search parameters (if there is no search, then `subtotal` would be the same as `total`)
* `limit` - number of objects return in this API call (for instance, if there are a total of 27 objects, `per_page` is 20, and you're on `page` 2, then only 7 objects would be returned, so the `limit` would be 7)
* `page` - page number
* `per_page` - objects per page
* `search` - search term used
* `sort`
    * `by` - the field that the collection is sorted by
    * `order` - sorted in ascending or descending order
* `results`(node-name configurable) - list (or collection) of objects; number of objects returned for a special call is equal to `limit`

The fields normally included in the `main` view will be included for each object in the collection, but a different view can be specified in the request parameters (ex. `view=full`).
