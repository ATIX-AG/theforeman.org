#### Index objects

Get of a list of domains: `GET /api/domains`

There is no data to send to the server on a **GET** request.

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" https://foreman.example.com/api/domains

This returns a collection response. The format for collection responses is described in Section 5.1.3.

#### Show an object

Grab a single domain: `GET /api/domains/$id` or `GET /api/domains/$name`

There is no data to send to the server on a **GET** request.

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/domains/42
    # or
    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/domains/foo

This returs a single object. The format for a single object response is described in Section 5.1.4.

#### Create an object

Create a new domain: `POST /api/domains/`

When creating a new object, **POST** a JSON hash with all the necessary fields to create the desired object. In this example, we're creating a domain.

    {
        "name": "foo.bar.com",
        "fullname" : "foo.bar.com description"
    }

&nbsp;

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "name":"foo.bar.com","fullname":"foo.bar.com description" }' https://foreman.example.com/api/domains

This returns the newly created object in the single response format (described in Section 5.1.4).

#### Delete an object

Delete a domain: `DELETE /api/domains/$id` or `DELETE /api/domains/$name`

There is no data to send to the server on a **DELETE** request.

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" -X DELETE \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/domains/17
    # or
    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" -X DELETE \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/domains/foo

This does not return an json if the operation was successful, only the HTTP status code.

#### Update an object

Update a domain: `PUT /api/domains/$id` or `PUT /api/domains/$name`

When updating an existing object, **PUT** a JSON hash containing only the data to be updated. So in our case, we just want to update the name of a domain, so we're only going to **PUT** `{ "name" : "a new name" }`.

&nbsp;

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" -X PUT \
        -d '{ "name": "a new name" }' https://foreman.example.com/api/domains/12
    # or
    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" -X PUT \
        -d '{ "name": "a new name" }' https://foreman.example.com/api/domains/foo

This returns the newly updated single object (in the single object response format).
