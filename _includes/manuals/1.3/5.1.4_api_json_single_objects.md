Single object responses are used for `show` actions (i.e. - "Show me this particular item").

    {
        "result" : {
            "id" : 1,
            "name" : "Library",
            "description" : null,
            "library" : true,
            "created_at" : "2013-11-06T18:24:01Z"
            "updated_at" : "2013-11-06T18:24:01Z"
            "label" : "Library",
        }
    }

The response's root node name is configurable, but defaults to `result`. The root node name can be altered by setting the name in a request parameter `root=output`.

Uses the `full` view for the object's returned fields by default. A view can be specified in the request to control the amount of data you get back for an object (ex. `view=main` or `view=full`).
