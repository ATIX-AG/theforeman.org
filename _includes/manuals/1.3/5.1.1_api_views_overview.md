There are two views for each object that can be accessed via different actions:

Whenever a request is sent to the server, a view will be used to represent the object(s) returned. There are two available views: `main` and `full` which are described below. A view can be specified by adding a `view=<view_name>` parameter onto any request sent to the server. If no view parameter is given, `main` is used by default. Below are examples of a Katello Environment object.

1. `main` - All fields of the given object. This is the default view for any object whenever requested, or you can add `view=main` to the request parameters.

        {
            "id" : 1,
            "name" : "Library",
            "description" : null,
            "library" : true,
            "created_at" : "2013-11-06T18:24:01Z"
            "updated_at" : "2013-11-06T18:24:01Z"
            "label" : "Library",
        }

2. `full` - All fields of the given object plus references (`_id` and `_name`) to other objects associated with this one. Add `view=full` to the request parameters to have data rendered with this view.

        {
            "id" : 1,
            "name" : "Library",
            "description" : null,
            "library" : true,
            "created_at" : "2013-11-06T18:24:01Z"
            "updated_at" : "2013-11-06T18:24:01Z",
            "label" : "Library",
            "prior" : null,
            "organization" : {
                "organization_name" : "ACME_Corporation",
                "organization_id" : 1
            },
            "systems" : [
                {
                    "system_name" : "system1",
                    "system_id" : 12
                },
                {
                    "system_name : "system5",
                    "system_id" : 27
                }
            ],
            "distibutors" : []
        }
