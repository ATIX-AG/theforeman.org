Parameterized class support permits detecting, importing, and supplying parameters direct to classes which support it, via the ENC.  This requires Puppet 2.6.5 or higher.

#### Setup

By default, parameterized class support is enabled in Foreman.  This can be checked from *Administer > Settings > Puppet* and ensure *Parametrized_Classes_in_ENC* is set to *true*.

![Settings](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/settings.png)

Now you'll need to import some parameterized classes from your Puppet master.
If you don't have any parameterized classes in your modules dir, the
foreman-installer has several, you can download a few modules from the Puppet
Forge. Once you have some parameterized modules, import your classes (see
[**4.2.2 Classes**](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.2Classes))

#### Configure a class

This example will work with the *foreman* class from the installer. Click on the class, and you should get a page with 3 tabs, like so:

![3 Tabs](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/3tabs.png)

The middle tab, "Smart Class Parameter", is the important one. Click onto that, and you should see something like this:

![Edit](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/edit.png)

On the left, we have a list of possible parameters that the class supports. On the right, we have the configuration options for the parameter selected.

Lets configure the *foreman* class to change the user the foreman processes run as. Select the *user* parameter, at the end of the list. Now lets go through the options:

* Puppet Environments / Name
   * These can't be edited, they're just for information.
* Description
   * Purely information textbox for making notes in. Not passed to Puppet, or reused anywhere else
* Override (**important**)
   * If this is unchecked, Foreman will not attempt to control this variable, and it will not be passed to Puppet via the ENC.
* Type
   * The type of data we want to pass. Most commonly a string, but many other data types are supported. There's no easy way to tell what type of data Puppet is expecting, so you will need to read through the code/documentation that comes with a particular module to find out. Changing the type field requires an appropriately set "Default Value" field.
* Default Value
   * This will be imported from Puppet initially, but if Puppet is using any class inheritance, you'll get something unhelpful like "${$foreman::params::user}". This is because Foreman won't follow the inheritance, so you'll need to set a sensible default value

Ok, so let's configure our *user* parameter. We want to tick Override, set type to "String" and set the default value to "foreman", like so:

![User Param](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/user-param.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">Tip: you can set Override on all parameters on a class from the Puppet classes list, clicking the dropdown menu on the right and clicking "Override all parameters".</div>

#### Setting up matchers

We've configured the default, but that's not very useful. We need to be able to override the default for hosts or groups of hosts. To do that we need the "Override Value For Specific Hosts" section at the bottom of the page.

Let's say that any machine in the "development" Puppet environment should use a value of "foremandev" instead of "foreman" for the "user" parameter. Add "environment" to the end of the matchers list, then click the "New Matcher-Value" button, and fill it out like this:

![Matcher](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/matcher.png)

This is a basic configuration - for more complex examples of using matchers,
see the [Smart Matchers](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.6SmartMatchers) section.

#### Overriding a parameter for a host

If Foreman manages the value of a class parameter ("override = true"), it's also possible to update a host-specific override from the host itself. That way you don't have to grant access to the Puppet Classes page to everyone. From a Host, click Edit, go to the Parameters tab, and you'll see the variable, the class-scope, and the current value. You can then override the value for that host:

![Host Edit](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/hostedit.png)

If you go back and look at the Puppet class, you'll see Foreman has added a matcher for that host:

![Host Matcher](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/hostmatch.png)

The same override button is available on a host group's *Parameters* tab.  For more complex logic, like matching on facts, use the Puppet Class page.

#### Advanced usage

Smart class parameters are based on the smart matchers technology, and have a number of advanced features such as validation and multiple data types. More about these can be found in the [Smart Matchers](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.6SmartMatchers) section.
