Activate the BMC management module within the Smart Proxy instance.  This allows users to trigger power management commands through the proxy to controlled hosts using IPMI or similar.

<pre>
:enabled: true
:bmc_default_provider: freeipmi
</pre>

Available providers are:

* `freeipmi` - for IPMI control using the freeipmi implementation
* `ipmitool` - using the ipmitool implementation
* `shell` - specialized provider for controlling the proxy server itself (used for Foreman Discovery)

The credentials and addresses used to control hosts are passed from Foreman itself by adding a new network interface with the type set to "BMC" to hosts.
