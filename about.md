---

Foreman will handle the completely lifecycle of servers from creation to provisioning to domain management.

It supports a wide variety of different operating systems, including:

* RedHat (CentOS) 3, 4 and 5 and 6.
* Fedora 10 - 16
* Ubuntu 9.04, 9.10, 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10, 12.04
* Debian Lenny, Squeeze
* Solaris 8, 10
* OpenSUSE 11.4

That would also include everything which is required to get puppet running on your host (e.g.):

* PuppetCA management
* TFTP management
* DNS management
* DHCP management
* Virtual machine and cloud management (oVirt, EC2, Libvirt, VMWare, OpenStack...)
