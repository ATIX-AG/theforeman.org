          Foreman is a provisioning, management, and reporting tool that's built atop Puppet. Foreman creates everything you need when adding a new machine to your network. Its goal is to seemlessly manage what you'd would normally manage manually - this includes DNS, DHCP, TFTP, PuppetCA, CMDB, and virtual machines with a variety of public and private cloud providers. You can always rebuild hosts from scratch!
